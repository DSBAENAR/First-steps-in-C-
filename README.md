1. Making a story by user input
2. You have three types of coins:
  A bronze coin is worth 1 cent
  A silver coin is worth 5 cents
  A gold coin is worth 10 cents
  What is the minimum number of coins that equals 98 cents?
  
  It’s a hard question to answer in your head, but it’s a fun problem to solve with programming. In this project you’ll use C# to build a Money Maker: a program in which
  a user enters an amount and gets the minimum number of coins that equal that value.
  
  For example, 16 cents could be:
  
  16 bronze coins,
  3 silver coins and 1 bronze coin, or
  1 gold coin, 1 silver coin, 1 bronze coin
  
3. In this project you’ll make a program that measures the strength of any given password based on the following criteria. A strong password:

is at least 8 characters long
has lowercase letters
has uppercase letters
has numerical digits
has symbols, like #, ?, !
The program will ask the user to input a password, and using conditional logic and control flow, it will rate the password.

4. Choose Your Own Adventure
In this project, you’ll use logic and conditional statements to write a classic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game. Depending on what choices your user makes, the program will have a different result. If you’re interested in game development, this is a great project to get your started! While we’re only working with text, the principles of user input and control flow are used to build even highly advanced games.

We’ve provided you with a template to write a game, but we highly encourage you to take what you’ve learned here and use your creativity to write an original game, either here on Codecademy or off-platform!

5. Architect Arithmetic
Architects have big ideas – but big ideas can be expensive. How expensive? Depends on the size.
In this project, you’ll use methods to build a program that calculates the material cost for any architect’s floor plan. In this case, i had to calculate the cost for teotihuacan building.
